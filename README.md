The Sheepie bot is a Discord bot created using Discord.js. I am currently using it to test out functionality that I will add to other bots that I create for the [Cyberdragon Discord server](https://discord.gg/VXGhyvN) in the future . At the moment I am slapping in as much functionality as a can in an attempt to get a better understanding of JavaScript, Discord.js, Node and just life really...

Please let me know if you see anything that looks like it could be done better. Half the time I don't know what I'm doing so if you do, you can probably help me :upside_down_face:.

I'll put up a list of commands and how to use them at a later date (After the commands have been established).
